# Credit-Calcualtor

Project : Credit Calculator

calculate some financial instruments like the : Annuity payment , Differentiate payment

## Annuity payment 
<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=PV = P \times \frac{1 - (1 + r)^{-n}}{r}">
PV	=	present value of an ordinary annuity ,

P	=	value of each payment ,

r	=	interest rate per period ,

n	=	number of periods ,


## Differentiate payment 


<img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=Dm = \frac{P}{n} +i*( P - \frac{\left ( P* (m - 1) \right )}{n})">

Dm = mth differentiated payment;

P = the loan principal;

i = nominal interest rate. This is usually 1/12 of the annual interest rate, and itâ€™s usually a float value, not a percentage. For example, if our annual interest rate = 12%, then i = 0.01.

n = number of payments. This is usually the number of months in which repayments will be made.

m = current repayment month.
